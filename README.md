# Welcome to SQL - Mellon City Mysteria!

SQL - Mellon City Mysteria is the brainchild of two Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) graduate students with a passion for data and a love for mystery-solving adventures. üíª‚ù§
 
Here's how this thrilling game came to life: We were finding for ways to hone our SQL skills, when we came stumbled across the SQL Murder Mystery (https://mystery.knightlab.com/), which is a self-directed lesson for mastering SQL commands and concepts. Intrigued and enjoying the challenge, we envisioned taking this concept to the next level by making it accessible for non-programming folks!

We recognized a lack of one-player murder mystery games with an interactive element. Hence, we thought it would be a good idea to blend our love for programming with the excitement of a murder mystery. We also took this as a challenge to integrate two programming languages that we are familiar with - SQL and Python! 

We modified the original SQL game and its database to suit our vision for SQL - Mellon City Mysteria. This endeavor has allowed us to showcase our creativity and programming skills while offering an unique and enjoyable experience to players. We invite you to share ant thoughts, feedback, and suggestions you might have. As active members of the data community, we value collaboration and continuous learning. 

Thank you for embarking on this SQL mystery adventure with us. We sincerely hope you enjoyed playing the game as much as we enjoyed creating it! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîç
